1. Overview
Purpose: Identifies two phases (Momentum and Trend Exhaustion) to spot potential trend reversals.
Phases:
Momentum Phase: 9‑bar (sometimes 8‑bar) count.
Trend Exhaustion Phase: 13‑bar count triggered after a completed Momentum Phase.
2. Inputs / Settings
All user‑configurable options are declared at the top via input.* calls:

Momentum Phase

Display Phases: 'Completed', 'Detailed', or 'None'
Support & Resistance Levels: Toggle lines
Momentum Phase Risk Levels: Toggle risk lines
Trend Exhaustion Phase

Display Phases: 'Completed', 'Detailed', or 'None'
Trend Exhaustion Phase Risk Levels: Toggle risk lines
Trend Exhaustion Phase Target Levels: Toggle target lines
Trade Setups

Phase Specific Trade Setup Options: 'Momentum', 'Exhaustion', 'Qualified', or 'None'
Price Flips against the Phase Specific Trade Setups: Toggles warning labels when price moves against a just‑triggered signal
These inputs dictate what phases are visible, whether lines/levels are displayed, and which trade signals are generated.

3. Internal Data Structures
Script defines three type blocks:

bar
Stores open, high, low, close, and bar index.
trb (momentum phase tracking)
bSC, sSC: bullish/bearish momentum counters
bSH/bSL, sSH/sSL: tracking extremes (high/low) within momentum phase
tre (trend exhaustion tracking)
bCC, sCC: bullish/bearish exhaustion counters
bC8/sC8: store the bar’s close when the 8th exhaustion count occurs
bCHt/bCLt/sCHt/sCLt: track highest/lowest bar within exhaustion phase
bCD/sCD: “risk” levels for bullish/bearish exhaustion
bCT/sCT: “target” levels for bullish/bearish exhaustion
4. Momentum Phase Logic
Uses a 9‑bar count (bSC for bullish, sSC for bearish).
Checks if bar close is higher (bullish) or lower (bearish) vs. close 4 bars ago.
Once count reaches 9, it’s considered a completed momentum phase.
Plots optional S/R lines (from highest/lowest in that 9‑bar window) and risk levels (calculated from extremes).
5. Trend Exhaustion Phase Logic
Kicks in after a momentum phase completes.
Uses a 13‑bar count: price is compared to values two bars prior each step.
Once it reaches 13, the script considers the trend “exhausted” and plots an “E” label.
Optionally plots risk (stop) and target levels for that exhaustion phase.
6. Trade Setups
Controlled by Phase Specific Trade Setup Options input:
Momentum: Signals right after momentum phase completes.
Exhaustion: Signals after exhaustion phase completes.
Qualified: Requires an exhaustion phase plus an additional momentum sequence.
None: No trade signals at all.
Once a setup is triggered (e.g. completed phase), the script looks for a price flip in that phase’s direction (close > close[4] for bullish flip, or vice versa) and plots an “L” or “S” label.
7. Alerts
The alert() calls at the bottom detect when:
Momentum or exhaustion phases complete
Price crosses S/R levels or risk levels
A new trend direction is identified (bearish/bullish momentum)
8. Rendering & Visualization
Uses plotshape() to place labels (e.g. numbers 1–9, “E” for exhaustion).
Uses plot() to draw lines for S/R, risk, and target levels (choice of circles, step lines, or diamonds).
Controlled by user inputs to show/hide specific elements.
Summary of Flow
Inputs determine what phases or lines appear.
Momentum logic counts up to 9 for bullish/bearish.
Exhaustion logic starts counting up to 13 after momentum is complete.
Trade setups are signaled if a phase completes + a price flip occurs.
Alerts fire as soon as these conditions happen.
That’s the essential structure and functionality behind the script’s implementation.
