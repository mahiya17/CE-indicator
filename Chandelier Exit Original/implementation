1. Overview
Purpose: Uses an ATR‑based stop to signal potential trend direction changes.
Basic Idea: Plots dynamic “long stop” or “short stop” lines, flipping between them when price closes beyond the prior stop.
2. Inputs / Settings
ATR Period (length)
Default 22; controls the lookback for calculating the Average True Range.
ATR Multiplier (mult)
Default 3.0; multiplies the ATR to determine stop distance.
Use Close Price for Extremums (useClose)
If checked, the script uses the highest/lowest close over the ATR period rather than the absolute high/low.
Show Buy/Sell Labels (showLabels)
Toggles the display of “Buy” and “Sell” markers on the chart.
Highlight State (highlightState)
Fills the area between price and the stop line with a color to show whether it’s currently “long” or “short.”
Await Bar Confirmation (awaitBarConfirmation)
Delays alerts until a bar closes and confirms direction flips or signals.
3. Core Calculations
Calculate ATR
atr = mult * ta.atr(length)
Determine Long Stop
Finds highest close/high over length bars, subtracts ATR.
Uses logic to “ratchet” the stop upward if price remains above it.
Determine Short Stop
Finds lowest close/low over length bars, adds ATR.
Uses logic to “ratchet” the stop downward if price remains below it.
Direction Determination
dir is +1 for long, ‑1 for short, based on whether price closes above or below the previous stop line.
4. Buy & Sell Logic
Buy Signal
Triggers when dir flips from ‑1 to +1 (i.e.\ from short to long).
Plots a circle and optional “Buy” label at the new stop.
Sell Signal
Triggers when dir flips from +1 to ‑1 (i.e.\ from long to short).
Plots a circle and optional “Sell” label at the new stop.
5. Plot Rendering
Stop Lines
Plots the line for the active side (long or short).
Fills
If highlightState is on, fills the region between the stop line and the midpoint price (e.g.\ ohlc4) with green when long, red when short.
Labels
Plots shape markers for each Buy/Sell signal if showLabels is enabled.
6. Alerts
Configured via alertcondition() calls:
Direction Change (whenever dir differs from dir[1])
Buy (when buySignal is true)
Sell (when sellSignal is true)
If “Await Bar Confirmation” is checked, these alerts only fire once the bar closes.
7. Key Points
The script is licensed under GPL‑3.0.
It’s a classic Chandelier Exit approach: a trailing stop that flips long/short based on ATR multiples.
Defaults are 22‑period ATR, 3.0 multiplier, and “useClose” for extremums.
